<p><h1>About</h1></p>


<p>
Fangcheng Fu is currently a Boya Postdoctoral Researcher at the <a href="https://cs.pku.edu.cn">School of CS</a>, <a href="https://www.pku.edu.cn">Peking University</a>, and a recipient of the China National Postdoctoral Program for Innovative Talent. Before that, he received his Bachelor's and Ph.D. degrees in computer science from Peking University in 2018 and 2023, respectively, supervised by <a href="https://cuibinpku.github.io">Prof. Bin Cui</a>. Besides, he has accumulated for more than 4 years of industrial internship experience in Tencent Inc.
</p>

<p>
Fangcheng has broad interests in distributed machine/deep learning algorithms and systems as well as big data processing and analytic systems. He has published more than 30 papers in top academic conferences and journals such as SIGMOD, VLDB, SOSP, ASPLOS, ICML, NeurIPS, and TKDE. He is the designer and/or program committee (PMC) member for several system projects, including <a href="https://github.com/PKU-DAIR/Hetu">Hetu</a>, PowerFL, and <a href="https://github.com/Angel-ML/angel">Angel</a>. His works in these system projects have been featured in several billion- or even trillion-scale machine/deep learning applications in industries.

<p><h2>Research</h2></p>

<p>
My research generally focuses on how to make machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) more reachable and practical through advanced <b>machine learning system (MLSys)</b> techniques. Particularly, my research falls into two directions.

<ul>
<li>
Developing <b>efficient and robust distributed machine/deep learning systems</b> to bring down the cost of large-scale models (e.g., LLM, AIGC) training and inference.
</li>
<li>
Building <b>high-performance and privacy-preserving data processing and analytic systems</b>, aiming to process large-scale data efficiently and securely.
</li>
</ul>

Feel free to reach out if you are interested in working together on these topics!
